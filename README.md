# 🏏 IPL Match Winning Prediction

This project predicts the winning probability of IPL teams during a match using **Logistic Regression and Random Forest**. It was executed as a **college project** under the guidance of **Prof. Dr. Mansi Gyanchandani (NIT Bhopal)**. Initially, the model achieved an accuracy of **80.22%**, which was later improved to **99.82%** through optimization and better Algorithm.
